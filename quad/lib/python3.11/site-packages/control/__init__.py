"""
The Python Control Systems Library :mod:`control` provides common functions
for analyzing and designing feedback control systems.

Documentation is available in two forms: docstrings provided with the code,
and the python-control users guide, available from `the python-control
homepage <https://www.python-control.org>`_.

The docstring examples assume that the following import commands::

  >>> import numpy as np
  >>> import control as ct

Available subpackages
---------------------

The main control package includes the most common functions used in
analysis, design, and simulation of feedback control systems.  Several
additional subpackages are available that provide more specialized
functionality:

* :mod:`~control.flatsys`: Differentially flat systems
* :mod:`~control.matlab`: MATLAB compatibility module
* :mod:`~control.optimal`: Optimization-based control
* :mod:`~control.phaseplot`: 2D phase plane diagrams
